Dr Michael Geaghan (PhD),"Michael is a post-doctoral researcher in the Cairns group. His current research is focused on the genetic risk factors underlying psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia. In particular, his projects are aimed towards understanding the roles of variants affecting non-coding RNA function in the development and symptomatology of disease. Throughout his PhD program, he investigated the roles of schizophrenia-associated small RNAs and how their expression influenced gene networks and cellular function. Notably, his research identified a disruption of gene networks involved in immune cell function in schizophrenia, a result which was published in the Journal of Psychiatric Research in 2019. Through his research, Michael has developed skills in both laboratory-based techniques - including cell culture, next-generation RNA sequencing library preparation, and animal behavioural models - as well as computational techniques important for the analysis of high-throughput data generated by sequencing technologies.","/images/mg.1k.png",NA
Dr Ebrahim Mahmoudi (PhD),"Ebrahim is a postdoctoral researcher in the Cairns Laboratory. After the completion of his Bachelor’s degree at Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz, Ebrahim pursued a Master’s program in Biotechnology at Tarbiat Modares University. In 2015, Ebrahim joined the Cairns’ research group at the University of Newcastle to pursue a PhD in Medical Genetics, which was focused on a number of projects, and completed in 2019. His current research explores circRNA regulation and functional mechanisms in neurobiology and psychiatric disorders. Ebrahim is particularly interested in investigating circRNA expression and regulatory mechanisms, with a focus on miRNA sponging, transcriptional modification and translational capacities in neuronal cells and psychiatric diseases. Ebrahim specializes in both laboratory-based techniques including cell culture, next generation sequencing and animal models, as well as bioinformatics techniques to analyse sequencing data.","/images/em.1k.png",NA
Dylan Kiltschewskij (BBiomedSc - Hons Class I),"Dylan is a PhD candidate in the Cairns group,  since joining the Cairns lab as an Honours student, Dylan has undertaken a number of projects exploring the mechanistic basis and functional impact of microRNA in neuronal cells. Specifically, Dylan’s work has used multiple different methods of high-throughput RNA sequencing (i.e. mRNA-Seq, small RNA-Seq, Ribosome Profiling, Poly(A)-tail sequencing) to identify the post-transcriptional level at which microRNA regulate complementary mRNA transcripts, with particular emphasis on the behaviour of these molecules during neuronal excitation and differentiation. Through this work, Dylan has attained extensive expertise in cell culture-based lab techniques, as well as RNA sequencing library preparation and bioinformatic analysis. This work ultimately aims to profile the fundamental aspects of microRNA function in the brain to further our understanding of conditions in which microRNA function is disrupted, such as Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder and Depression.

William Reay (BBiomedSc - Hons Class I),"William is a PhD candidate in the Cairns’ laboratory with a project focusing on statistical genetics and functional genomics. William completed a Bachelor of Biomedical Science with first class honours at the University of Newcastle and joined the laboratory during undergraduate research placement. His research seeks to integrate principles of statistical genetics with systems biology to further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits and how this could be leveraged for treatment. In particular, William has a strong interest in the use of genomics for precision medicine and drug repositioning. William specialises in a number of important techniques relating to genomics including genome-wide association studies, polygenic risk scoring, transcriptomic imputation and Mendelian Randomisation with proficiency in the bioinformatic analysis of next generation sequencing. Thus far, William has published several first author papers and is passionate about communicating his research both online via twitter and by regularly presenting at conferences.

Michelle Barnett (BBiomedSc - Hons Class I),"Michelle is a PhD candidate in the Cairns laboratory with a project focussed on developing a blood-based, small RNA biomarker for schizophrenia. Michelle joined the Cairns lab during undergraduate study at the University of Newcastle after becoming fascinated by the role of miRNA in brain function. In particular, detecting alterations in brain associated miRNA through targeted capture of serum extracellular vesicles. This technique allows a minimally invasive analysis of the brain regulatory environment and can be applied to a wide range of neurological pathologies","/images/mb1k.png",NA
"Behnaz Khavari (B.S., M.S.)","Behnaz is a PhD candidate in the Cairns laboratory. She completed her undergraduate and master studies in Iran and moved to Australia in 2016 to do her PhD. In her project, she investigates the effects of environmental stress factors on the transcriptome of differentiating neuronal cells through applying RNA sequencing and bioinformatic analyses.","/images/bk.1k.png",NA
"Shahin Masserrat (B.S., M.S.)","Shahin is a Ph.D. candidate in the Cairns laboratory. Shahin completed his Bachelor of Microbiology in Iran and has been a member of the Cairns’ group since 2017. He is currently working on a project entitled Identifying causal variants and genes associated with schizophrenia. Shahin uses a range of bioinformatic approaches such as TWAS, COLOC, MAGMA and Sherlock to identify putative causal variants for schizophrenia. He is investigating the effect of candidate variants in cellular context by using CRISPR / Cas9 method.","/images/sm.1k.png",NA
Laura Greco,"Laura is a PhD candidate with a research area that covers molecular neurobiology and bioinformatics. Laura completed her Undergraduate degree with Honours at the University of Technology, Sydney and had a previous research focus on Parasitology and Biotechnology. Laura’s thesis topic involves identifying the molecular determinant of comorbid addiction in schizophrenia. Laura has experience with various laboratory techniques from RT-qPCR, Animal experimentation (surgery, perfusions, self-administration training). I am also an avid science communicator, not only presenting my work at national and international conferences but also working as a casual lecturer at the University of Newcastle and often engaging with the local community and schools about science and non-science related topics, from layman terms presentations to university pathways and career options.","/images/default.jpg",NA
Sarah Ribeiro (B.Biomed - Hons),"Sarah is a PhD candidate in the Cairns Laboratory. Sarah first came to Australia in 2013 with an awarded scholarship from the Brazilian government with the main aim to improve her English and since then fell in love with the Australian lifestyle and advanced sciences. She completed a Bachelor of Biomedical Sciences and honours first class in Brazil with an awarded second place prize in her Biomedical Sciences’ degree in 2016. Her current research is focused on the genetics of psychiatric disorders, with particular interest in major depression and anxiety traits. Sarah uses many molecular biology techniques in the lab including the exciting genome editing approaches as CRISPR/Cas9 system, base editors and anticipates using the most recent prime editing technique. These genome editing techniques are used to reproduce potential disease-associated variants in cell lines allowing further analysis to understand how these variants interfere with gene expression and cell biology.
